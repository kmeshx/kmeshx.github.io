# 1 Overview
The goal of this project is to implement and analyze the scalability, scope, and benet of performing
image segmentation in parallel. In particular, we implemented the sequential versions of K-Means, Otsu
Binarization, and Edge detection algorithms in C++ and their corresponding parallel versions using
CUDA and OpenMP.

# 2  Some Results
